## **Introduction**

The peer2profit is an option that allows users to earn money by sharing your traffic.

You'll receive $0.30 for the 1G traffic you share, and this script supports data center network or home bandwidth.

This is the **first one-click installation script of the whole network** to automatically install dependencies and pull and install the latest docker, and the script will continue to be improved according to the platform update.

It has below features:

1. Automatically install docker based on the system, and if docker are already installed, it will not installed again.

2. Automatically select and build the pulled docker image according to the architecture, without the need for you to manually modify the official case.

3. Use Watchtower for automatic mirror update without manual update and re-entry of parameters.

(Watchtower is a utility that automates the updating of Docker images and containers. It monitors all running containers and related images, and automatically pulls the latest image and uses parameters when initially deployed to restart the corresponding container.)
